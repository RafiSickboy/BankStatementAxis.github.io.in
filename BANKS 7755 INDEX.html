<b>EXHIBIT-A</b>

      <P>INDEMNIFICATION, DEFENSE AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
I.	Indemnification and Defense of Indemnified Parties

This Exhibit-A is attached to and incorporated by reference into the Agreement between Brill Securities, Inc. (including its division, Bose Capital Partners, hereinafter referred as “Brill”) and The Dacca  Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited (including any and all the divisions and affiliated entities of The Dacca  Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited,  hereinafter referred as “DDM” or “the Company”) dated February 25, 2010 (the “Agreement”).  The term “Indemnified Party” or “Indemnified Parties” mean Brill and all the directors, officers, employees, registered representatives, agents, divisions and attorneys of or for Brill, as well as its affiliates and each other Person, if any, controlling Brill or any of its affiliates.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which such Indemnified Parties may become subject (i) relating to, arising out of or in connection with the engagement of Brill pursuant to and the performance by Brill of the services contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Information (the term “Information” for “Exhibit – A” means any information provided by the Company or the actual or potential Investor/Investors), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state or include in the Information a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) caused by or arising out of any breach of this Agreement or breach of applicable law by the Company.  The Company will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel) as they are incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such action or claim, whether or not in connection with a pending or threatened litigation to which the Indemnified Party is a party, in each case, as such expenses are incurred or paid.  With respect to clause (i) above, the Company will not, however, be responsible for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or expenses relating thereto) that are finally judicially determined to have resulted from the willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party.  The Company also agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company for or in connection with this Agreement, the performance of services hereunder or otherwise arising out of the relationship between the Company , on one hand and any Indemnified Party, on the other hand except for any damages, if any, that a New York state or New York federal court has determined by final, non-appealable judgment were proximately caused by the willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party.</p>

<p>In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify  in writing (but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Company) and the Company, upon request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party and any others the Company may designate in such proceeding and shall timely pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel. The fact of the Company’s retention and payment for such counsel shall not imply or cause any waiver of attorney-client privilege for communications between the represented Indemnified Parties and such counsel.  Such counsel must be free of any conflict of interest with the Company in representing the Indemnified Parties. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, un¬less such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding without requiring such Indemnified Party to make any payment, and (ii) does not include any admission of fault or liability on the part of such  Indemnified Party.    
If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable to an Indemnified Party, then the Company in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party there under, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by each of the parties from the Transaction or proposed Transaction or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of each of the parties in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such loss¬es, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Exhibit-A, in no event shall Brill’s aggregate contribution to the amount paid or payable exceed the aggregate amount of fees actually received by Brill under the Agreement.  The indemnification and contribution rights provided for in this Exhibit-A  shall be in addition to any rights that Brill may have at common law or otherwise.
II.	Indemnification of the Company
Brill agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and employees from and against any claims, damages, losses and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (collectively, “Damages”) arising out of or based upon (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Brill, its employees, its agents or its registered representatives (for purpose of this Section II, the “Brill Parties”) under circumstances where the Brill Parties’ act was not specifically requested or consented to by the Company, and such Damages resulted primarily from such misconduct or gross negligence as determined by final judgment by a court having competent jurisdiction, or (ii) its use of information relating to the Company or the Transaction not in furtherance of this Agreement in a manner not authorized by the Company and for its failure to comply with applicable federal or state securities laws without the knowledge (whether actual or constructive) and authorization of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section II, Brill’s liability shall not exceed the amount of fees actually received by Brill under this Agreement.</p>

<p>III.	Limitations on Liability.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Brill and the other Indemnified Parties shall never be liable to the Company based on any claims, causes of action, theories, or laws in any aggregate amount exceeding the sum of the amounts of fees paid by the Company to Brill under this Agreement.   In no event shall Brill or any other Indemnified Parties be liable to the Company for consequential damages, lost profits, lost opportunities,  lost income, or punitive, multiple or exemplary damages, and the Company agrees to be barred and estopped from seeking any such damages from Brill and the other Indemnified Parties.  The aggregate liability limitations in the two preceding sentences apply collectively, and not separately, to any claims or causes of action, if any, against any or all the Indemnified Parties collectively; however, in the event of any dispute, if any, between Brill and the Company, or involving this Agreement, in which the Company believes that it has valid claims to assert based on Brill’s alleged or actual actions or omissions, whether acting through its registered representatives, agents or otherwise, the Company shall not pursue any claims against any Indemnified Parties other than Brill.  The Company acknowledges that neither Brill nor any other Indemnified Party has made any oral or written promise, representation, commitment, warranty, guarantee or assurance on which the Company is relying in entering into this Agreement or engaging Brill, except as contained in the express terms of this Agreement.  Neither Brill nor any other Indemnified Party has made any promises or guarantees with respect to the likelihood, success or terms of any Transaction or of any contacts with any Introduction</P>
